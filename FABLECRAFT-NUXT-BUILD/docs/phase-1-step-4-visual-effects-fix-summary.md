# Visual Effects Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Firefly Effect
**Before**: Fireflies weren't visible
**After**: 
- Fireflies now drift upward from bottom of screen
- Spread across screen width at positions: 8%, 16%, 28%, 37%, 49%, 62%, 73%, 84%, 93%, etc.
- Three size variants: small (2px), normal (3px), bright (4px)
- Curved drift animation with horizontal sway
- Glow breathing effect for realism
- Proper z-index (5) to appear above content

### 2. Background Orbs
**Before**: Stuck on right side of screen
**After**:
- Orb 1: 320px, positioned top: 15%, left: 8%
- Orb 2: 220px, positioned top: 65%, right: 15%  
- Orb 3: 180px, positioned bottom: 25%, left: 55%
- Gentle floating animation with scale changes
- 80px blur filter for soft effect
- Proper z-index (-1) to stay in background

### 3. State Management
**Before**: Checkboxes didn't control effects
**After**:
- All controls now use Nuxt's `useState` for SSR-safe state
- Firefly checkbox properly toggles fireflies
- Atmospheric gradient checkbox works
- Firefly count slider dynamically adjusts count (1-12)
- Performance mode affects both orbs and fireflies

### 4. Animations
**Added**:
- `firefly-drift`: Upward movement from bottom with curved path
- `firefly-glow`: Breathing light effect
- `orb-float-primary/secondary/tertiary`: Subtle floating movements

## Technical Implementation

### Following Nuxt 3 Best Practices:
1. **SSR-Safe State**: Using `useState` instead of `ref` for shared state
2. **GPU Acceleration**: All animations use `transform` and `will-change`
3. **Performance**: IntersectionObserver to animate only visible elements
4. **Accessibility**: `prefers-reduced-motion` support
5. **Component Names**: Using auto-imported names (EffectsBackgroundOrbs, EffectsFireflyEffect)

### Key Code Changes:

#### FireflyEffect.vue
- Pre-defined positions matching old build
- Dynamic firefly generation based on count
- Proper CSS variable injection for positioning

#### BackgroundOrbs.vue  
- Fixed positioning with proper CSS properties
- Performance-based orb count limiting
- Correct blur and opacity values

#### visual-effects.css
- Complete firefly drift animation with keyframes
- Firefly glow breathing effect
- Proper z-index layering

## Visual Result
- Fireflies drift upward across the screen
- Background orbs float gently in correct positions
- Atmospheric gradient adds depth
- All effects respond to controls
- Performance modes work correctly

The visual effects now match the old build's aesthetic while being properly implemented with modern Nuxt 3 standards!
