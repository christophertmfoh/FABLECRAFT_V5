# CRITICAL SAFETY RULES FOR AI AGENTS

## üö® FORBIDDEN COMMANDS - NEVER RUN THESE üö®

The following commands are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN and will PERMANENTLY DESTROY the development environment:

- ‚ùå kill node
- ‚ùå pkill node  
- ‚ùå killall node
- ‚ùå kill -9 [any node process]
- ‚ùå pkill -9 node
- ‚ùå systemctl stop node
- ‚ùå service node stop
- ‚ùå Any forceful termination of node processes

## ‚úÖ SAFE ALTERNATIVES

### To stop the development server:
1. Use Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running
2. Close the terminal tab
3. Run on a different port if needed: `npx nuxi dev --port 3003`

### To check processes:
- `ps aux | grep node` (VIEW ONLY, don't kill)
- `lsof -i :3002` (check port usage)
- `pnpm run safe-stop` (use the safe helper script)

## WHY THIS MATTERS

These commands don't just stop the server - they DESTROY the Cursor environment connection permanently. The environment becomes unusable and all work is lost.

## DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS

Safe commands to use:
- `pnpm dev:alt` or `npx nuxi dev --port 3002` - Start development
- `Ctrl+C` - Stop any running process
- `pnpm run safe-stop` - Check processes safely

Remember: When something seems stuck, use a different port instead of trying to kill processes.
