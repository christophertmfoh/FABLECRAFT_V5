# 🚨 AGENT: START HERE FIRST! 🚨

## ⚡ Quick Start for AI Agents

**CRITICAL**: Before doing ANY work, run this initialization:

```bash
./AGENT_INIT.sh
```

Or:

```bash
npm run init
```

This will:
- ✅ Activate safety protections
- ✅ Prevent accidental Cursor disconnection
- ✅ Set up your development environment
- ✅ Show you safe alternatives to dangerous commands

## 🛑 NEVER USE THESE COMMANDS:
- ❌ `killall node`
- ❌ `pkill node`
- ❌ `kill -9 node`

## ✅ ALWAYS USE THESE INSTEAD:
- ✅ `npm run safe-stop` - Stop dev server
- ✅ `Ctrl+C` - Stop running process
- ✅ `npm run dev:alt` - Use alternative port

## 📋 Key Commands:
```bash
npm run init       # Initialize safety (RUN THIS FIRST!)
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run safe-stop  # Stop server safely
check_ports        # Check port usage (after init)
```

- `SAFETY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - How the safety system works

**Remember**: Running `./AGENT_INIT.sh` first will save you from accidentally breaking your connection!
