# Phase 1 Implementation Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit reviews the Phase 1 implementation of the Fablecraft Nuxt build. While the basic project structure was created, several critical steps were missed or implemented incorrectly.

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

### 1. Project Initialization
- Nuxt 3 project created successfully
- Git repository initialized
- `.npmrc` file created with `save-exact=true` for version locking

### 2. Core Dependencies
Successfully installed with exact versions:
- `@nuxtjs/supabase@1.4.0`
- `@pinia/nuxt@0.7.0`
- `@vueuse/nuxt@11.3.0`
- `@tiptap/vue-3@2.10.3`
- `@tiptap/pm@2.10.3`
- `@tiptap/starter-kit@2.10.3`

### 3. Development Dependencies
Successfully installed:
- `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss@6.12.2`
- `tailwind-merge@2.6.0`
- `lucide-vue-next@0.460.0`
- `class-variance-authority@0.7.1`
- `clsx@2.1.1`

### 4. Page Structure
All required pages created in correct directory structure:
```
pages/
├── index.vue
└── project/
    └── [id]/
        ├── index.vue
        ├── world-bible.vue
        ├── outline.vue
        ├── manuscript.vue
        ├── storyboard.vue
        ├── pre-vis.vue
        ├── scoring.vue
        └── community.vue
```

### 5. Configuration Files
- `tailwind.config.js` - Created with proper content paths
- `postcss.config.js` - Created with basic configuration
- `nuxt.config.ts` - Has most required modules configured
- `.prettierrc` - Created
- `eslint.config.mjs` - Created

## ❌ Missing or Incorrect

### 1. Critical Missing Step: npm install
**CRITICAL**: The `npm install` command was never executed
- No `node_modules/` directory exists
- This is why the development server failed to start

### 2. Incorrect Dependency Versions
- `radix-vue@1.9.17` installed instead of `radix-vue@1.10.0`
- `shadcn-nuxt@0.10.4` installed but never initialized

### 3. Shadcn-vue Not Initialized
- No `components.json` configuration file
- No UI components installed
- The `npx shadcn-vue@latest init` command was never run

### 4. App Structure Issues
- `app.vue` is in `app/` directory instead of root
- `app.vue` still contains `<NuxtWelcome />` instead of `<NuxtPage />`
- Should either remove app.vue or properly configure it

### 5. Missing CSS Configuration
- `assets/css/main.css` exists with Tailwind directives
- But Tailwind plugins were added prematurely (should be empty initially)

### 6. Page Content
- All pages were created but are empty (0 bytes)
- The index.vue has content but other pages need implementation

## ⚠️ Deviations from Guide

### 1. Tailwind Configuration
**Current** (has plugins):
```javascript
plugins: [
  require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
]
```

**Should be** (empty initially):
```javascript
plugins: [],
```

### 2. Nuxt Configuration
Missing several configurations:
- No `@nuxt/image` module
- Missing shadcn configuration block
- Missing runtime config
- Missing nitro optimization settings

## 🔧 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd "FABLECRAFT NUXT BUILD"
npm install
```

### 2. Fix app.vue Location
Either:
- Move `app/app.vue` to root and update it:
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <NuxtPage />
  </div>
</template>
```
OR
- Delete app.vue entirely (Nuxt will use pages/ automatically)

### 3. Initialize Shadcn-vue
```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest init
```

### 4. Remove Tailwind Plugins (for now)
Update `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
plugins: [],
```

### 5. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Phase Completion Status

**Phase 1 Completion: 65%**

Key missing items:
1. Dependencies not installed (npm install)
2. Shadcn-vue not initialized
3. App structure needs correction
4. Development server not tested

## 📋 Recommendations

1. **Complete Phase 1 properly** before moving to Phase 2
2. **Run npm install** immediately
3. **Initialize Shadcn-vue** as specified
4. **Test the development server** to ensure everything works
5. **Do not proceed to Phase 2** (Supabase) until Phase 1 is fully functional

## 🚨 Critical Note

The agent accidentally killed Node processes. This should be avoided as it can interrupt running development servers and other Node-based tools.
