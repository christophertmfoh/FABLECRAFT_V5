# Priority 6 Components Implementation Plan

## Overview
Priority 6 includes 4 special effect components focused on visual feedback and accessibility.

## Components to Implement

### 1. Dot Component (Pulsing Indicator)
- **Purpose**: Visual indicator with pulsing animation
- **Key Features**:
  - CSS-only animation
  - Respects prefers-reduced-motion
  - Configurable size and color
  - Accessible with proper ARIA

### 2. StarRating Component
- **Purpose**: Accessible star rating input
- **Key Features**:
  - Built with radio buttons for semantic correctness
  - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
  - Screen reader friendly
  - Visual feedback on hover/focus
  - Configurable max stars

### 3. StepNumber Component
- **Purpose**: Circular badge with number for process steps
- **Key Features**:
  - Semantic HTML
  - Proper ARIA labels
  - Visual states (active, completed, pending)
  - Configurable size and color

### 4. VisuallyHidden Component
- **Purpose**: Hide content visually but keep it accessible to screen readers
- **Key Features**:
  - Standard SR-only pattern
  - Utility component for accessibility
  - Maintains focusability when needed

## Technical Considerations

### Accessibility First
- All components must be keyboard navigable
- Proper ARIA attributes and roles
- Screen reader tested patterns
- Color contrast compliance

### Performance
- CSS-only animations where possible
- No unnecessary JavaScript
- Efficient rendering
- SSR-safe implementation

### Scalability
- Consistent prop interfaces
- Reusable utility functions
- Theme-aware styling
- TypeScript for type safety

### Code Quality
- Single responsibility principle
- Clear documentation
- Comprehensive test cases in devview
- Follow existing component patterns

## Implementation Order
1. VisuallyHidden (foundation for others)
2. Dot (simple visual component)
3. StepNumber (builds on Dot concepts)
4. StarRating (most complex, uses VisuallyHidden)
