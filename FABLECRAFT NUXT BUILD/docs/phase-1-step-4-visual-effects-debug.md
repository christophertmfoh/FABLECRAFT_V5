# Visual Effects Debug Report

## Issues Fixed

1. **Component Name Mismatch**
   - Components are auto-imported with "Effects" prefix
   - Changed from `<BackgroundOrbs>` to `<EffectsBackgroundOrbs>`
   - Changed from `<FireflyEffect>` to `<EffectsFireflyEffect>`

2. **Reactive State Issues**
   - Removed `readonly()` wrapper from useState returns in `useBackgroundOrbs`
   - This was preventing proper reactivity and state updates
   - Now returns direct references to useState values

3. **SSR-Safe State Management**
   - Using `useState` instead of `ref` for global state
   - Ensures proper hydration between server and client
   - Prevents hydration mismatches

4. **Performance Mode Initialization**
   - Added automatic initialization on client mount
   - Uses `onMounted` hook to detect device capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Corrected Component Usage
```vue
<!-- Before (incorrect) -->
<BackgroundOrbs />
<FireflyEffect />

<!-- After (correct) -->
<EffectsBackgroundOrbs />
<EffectsFireflyEffect />
```

### Corrected State Management
```typescript
// Before (breaks reactivity)
return {
  orbsEnabled: readonly(orbsEnabled),
  performanceMode: readonly(performanceMode),
  orbCount: readonly(orbCount)
}

// After (proper reactivity)
return {
  orbsEnabled,
  performanceMode,
  orbCount
}
```

## Visual Effects Now Working

1. **Background Orbs** - Animated gradient orbs floating in background
2. **Firefly Effect** - Small glowing particles with drift animation  
3. **Atmospheric Gradient** - Subtle gradient overlay for depth

All effects are:
- GPU-accelerated using CSS transforms
- Respecting performance modes
- SSR-safe with proper hydration
- Reactive to user controls

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Effects toggle button works
- [x] Performance mode selector updates effects
- [x] Firefly count slider adjusts particle count
- [x] Individual effect toggles work
- [x] No hydration mismatches
- [x] 60fps performance maintained
